# Image Server / Repo Server

This server will be used to serve:
 - The List of all available Systems
 - Channels for these Systems
 - Images (Links or Files)
 - An Admin Control Panel, to manage this thing

# How to

First install all dependencies
```npm i```
and start the Server with
```npm start```

Now go to ```http://localhost:8190/Register``` and register an Account.
(The first registered Account is always an Admin Account)

You can now create an Operating System to be hosted on this Repo.
