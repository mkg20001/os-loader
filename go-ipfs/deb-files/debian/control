Description: IPFS - the Distributed Web
 IPFS is a global, versioned, peer-to-peer filesystem.
 It combines good ideas from Git, BitTorrent, Kademlia, SFS, and the Web.
 It is like a single bittorrent swarm, exchanging git objects.
 IPFS provides an interface as simple as the HTTP web, but with permanence built in.
 You can also mount the world at /ipfs.
